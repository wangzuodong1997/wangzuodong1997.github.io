    "#### Second practical work, Monday,  September 26, 2022\n",
    "In this second practical work, we introduce the *Euler method*. It is the most famous and simple numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations. We compare it to another numerical scheme, the so-called *midpoint method*, a little bit more tricky to implement but usually way more efficient. First, run the following cells to import the librairies used in this Notebook."
